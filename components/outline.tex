%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Part I: Introduction and Theory}

 {\scshape Chapter 1: Introduction}\\
The description of the light simulation in the participting media
takes place here from the most general point of view. What problem we are trying
to solve, and why it is important.

{\scshape Chapter 2: Theory}\\
Theory of the light transport with emission, attenuation and
scattering laws. Parametrization. Pathtracing theory. Next Event estimation.
Importance sampling.
MIS. Diffusion theory, maybe an overview for the Diffusion Approximation.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Part II: Implementation and measurements}

{\scshape Chapter 3: Pathtracing}\\
Pathtracing implementation details. Correctness of the method and
problems in practical usage

{\scshape Chapter 3: Pathtracing with Next Even Estimation}\\
PTDL integrator. It's advantages and failure cases.

{\scshape Chapter 3: Diffusion Approximation}\\
Diffusion Approximation as an approach to render in certain
scenarious. DA integrator, disk sampling and other approaches. Precomputed
BSSRDFs, Christenen Burley profile, fitting to Monte-Carlo references and
it's importance sampling. Parametrization issue.

\comment{Currently in TODO status}
{\scshape Chapter 3: Comparisons and measurements}\\
Measurements, data and comparisons between different
implementations. Convergence graphs.
