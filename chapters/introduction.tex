\section{Intuition behind Diffusion approximation and BSSRDF formulation}

\subsection{Analogy to BRDF approximation}
\label{section:BSSRDF_intuition}
Formulate scattering in media in analogy to local surface reflectance (BRDF)

\subsection{Single scattering and Multiple scattering}
Decompose into single- and multiscattering terms

\subsection{Double scattering paper}
\cite{Donner:2009:EBM} model is the most accurate to date (2013), but it has a
high memory cost (up to 250 MB for each material). It is also limited to a
single lobe. \cite{holzschuch:hal-00760054} extends and completes Donner's
study. They also provide a model that is less accurate, but much more compact
and can represent multiple lobes.

\subsection{Searchlight problem formulation}
\label{section:searchlight}
Simplify model to the 'Searchlight Problem' to allow analytic solutions.

\subsection{Isotropic and Anisotropic phase functions}
\label{section:phasefunction_approximation}
Only isotropic phase function is considered in this work. The is a common approximation of reduced

\section{Donner's Empirical BSSRDF}
This strange \gls{BSSRDF}
\comment{I like the reasoning here}
Donner et al. \cite{Donner:2009:EBM} claim that the sum of single scattering
simulation and diffusion approximation (isotropic multiple scattering) does not
able to capture materials with relatively large suspended particles (such as
orange juice or milk). Because of the significant amount of light in scattered
during to low-order scattering events and high absorption.
These materials exhibit significant absorption of the light as it propagates
through the material, so much of the energy is scattered back into
the environment near the point of incidence. This light exits in areas and
directions outside of the single scattering regime, but not in the high-order
multiple scattering regime.


In this work they use Monte Carlo particle tracing to tabulate an empirical
BSSRDF model for a flat surface on a homogeneous semi-infinite volume.
They represented the hemispherical distribution of light leaving the surface,
depending on the angle of the incident light, the relative position of the
excitant light, and the physical parameters (volume albedo, mean free path
length, phase function, and index of refraction). The tables took months to
compute and contain around 250MB of data.

\section{Scattering in the thin objects}
Diffuse transmission BTDF is a fast approximation of subsurface scattering
in thin materials.
Many real world objects like sheets of paper or foliage of the trees has strong
scattering component. There is a simple and inexpensive technique to approximate
scattering in such objects by using the Lambertian BTDF.
