\section{Measured sigmas}
Huge measurements work was done here \cite{Gkioulekas:2013:IVR:2508363.2508377}
TODO: Check how their results differ from little table of Jensen
\cite{Jensen:2001:PMS:383259.383319}

Diffusion profiles can be measured from a real-world object by
analyzing scattering of laser \cite{Jensen:2001:PMS:383259.383319} or
structured light patterns \cite{tariq_efficient_2006-1} Big variaty of
liquids by dilusion was asquired in
\cite{Narasimhan:2006:ASP:1141911.1141986} but only single scattering
component (is it right)
