\section{Scattering in thin objects}
Highly diffusive Bidirectional Transmission Distribution Function (BTDF) can be used as a fast
approximation of subsurface scattering in thin materials. Many real world objects like sheets of
paper or foliage of the trees has strong scattering component. There is a simple and inexpensive
technique to approximate scattering in such objects by using the Lambertian BTDF. Apart from that,
there are other more correct methods described in the literature. The recent work on the rendering
of the paper material \cite{DBLP:journals/cgf/PapasMJ14} can be seen as the further advances of the
earlier research of representation of translucent materials \cite{Donner:2005:LDM:1186822.1073308}.
