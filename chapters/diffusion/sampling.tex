\emph{Quote \cite{Burley:disney_siggraph15}: Sampling can be difficult and expensive. Diffusion
integration requires distributing samples over the entire surface with known
density, preferably proportional to the diffusion profile. We can generate
such samples within a plane, but projecting this density through a solid may
lead to oversampling of some parts of the surface and undersampling of the
others.
Using MIS between multiple planes \cite{King:2013:BIS:2504459.2504520}  helps prevent
undersampling but oversampling is still a problem. Each plane sample also
requires ray probing to find surface hits, and if there are multiple
intersections we build a conditional CDF based on the distance to each point,
then stochastically choose a point to sample.}
