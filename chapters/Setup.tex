Perpendicular light beam to infinite surface \cite{Jacques1995}

The term is: \gls{infiniteslab},


\section{Diffusion profiles}
\comment{Think about how to organize this section}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Diffusion profiles can be measured from a real-world object by analyzing
  scattering of laser \cite{Jensen:2001:PMS:383259.383319} or structured light
  patterns \cite{tariq_efficient_2006-1} Big variaty of liquids by dilusion
  was asquired in \cite{Narasimhan:2006:ASP:1141911.1141986} but only single
  scattering component (is it right)
  \item{And the most advanced method capturing both single and multple
  scattering is described \cite{Gkioulekas:2013:IVR:2508363.2508377}}}
\item{\cite{Nguyen:2007:GG:1407436} in \textit{GPU Gems 3} says that
the dipole and multipole functions mentioned already can be used to compute diffusion profiles
for any material with known scattering coefficients.
}
\item{While knowing the correct diffusion profiles one can use fitting tool to approximate them \cite{Nguyen:2007:GG:1407436}}
\end{itemize}
