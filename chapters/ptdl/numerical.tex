\section{Path tracing and numerical stability issues}
\label{section:numerical}

Unbiased nature of the brute force volumetric path tracing estimator and physically based
parametrization makes it a perfect candidate for implementing the reference integrator.
The inherent characteristic of the brute force volumetric path tracing estimator is a high variance,
which leads to long rendering times in practice. Being applicable in practice, variance reduction
techniques usually employed. For example Russian Roulette is one of them. The theoretical
description of the Russian Roulette technique can be found in the section \ref{subsection:rr}.

There are different approaches to find the optimal strategy for choosing the Russian Roulette path
termination probability $q_{rr}$ \cite{Veach:1998:RMC:927297}, \cite{And_findinggood}. But usually
it is considered as a complicated task, highly dependent on the particular scene configuration  and
lighting distribution. $q_rr$ is often exposed to the user as parameter of the integrator.

The use of Russian Roulette in the context of volumetric path tracing may lead to unexpected loss of
energy during simulations. It is observed as the objects are rendered darker than they should. The
cause of this effect could be the numerical cancellation which appear during rendering of the high
albedo materials with high scattering coefficients. These materials with scattering distance much
smaller than the characteristic object scale $L$ and low attenuation are characterized by high
transmission coefficient $\sigma_t = \sigma_a + \sigma_s$. Tracing the path inside the volume of
such object requires a large number of random walk steps. 

If $q_{rr}$ is the probability of the path to terminate at each step of random walk, then the
probability of the scattering to continue is defined by $p_{rr} = 1 - q_{rr}$. In case if the
termination is not happening at the current step, the Russian Roulette weight $w_{rr}$ is
multiplied by the $1/(p_rr)$. And after $n$ iterations the weight is equal to:
\begin{equation}
w_{rr} = p_{rr}^{-n}
\end{equation}

As $p_{rr}$ is is a probability and is in a range of $[0,1]$, the value of $w_{rr}$ for large $n$
can lower down to floating point precision.

It is possible to build heuristic approach to estimate the minimum allowed Russian Roulette
threshold parameter on the basis of the scattering properties of the media, while still being sure
that there is no energy is lost because of numerical cancellation.

Let us consider the common case of the rendering scenario when the final pixel values of the
simulation are \emph{in the order} of the 1.0. This is a fair assumption because even the special
cases of rendering images with high dynamic range rarely goes above the values in the order of 100.0
which does not change the conclusions of this section.

Following the basics of the the diffusion theory and the theory of the random walks in 3d
\cite{PRE:8383976}, the expected distance at which particle could be found after $n$ steps of random
walk with the constant step size of $d$ is in the order of $R\sim\sqrt{nd}$. Let us consider the the
geometric object with the characteristic depth $L$. The length of the random walk step of path
tracing is in the order of mean free path scattering length $1/(\sigma_s+\sigma_a)=1/\sigma_t$. We
can expect the particle starting the random walk in this object will leave it, in average, after $n$
steps:
\begin{equation}
n\sim\sigma_tL^2
\end{equation}

As we want to make sure that $w_{rr}$ is not going down to less than the cancellation limit of
$\epsilon\sim10^{-7}$ for the addition of the single precision floting point numbers with
characteristic values in the accumulation buffer $C_0\sim1$:
\[
w_{rr} = p_{rr}^{-n} \sim p_{rr}^{-\sigma_tL^2} > 10^{-7}
\]

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rr_heuristic}
p_{rr} > 10^{\frac{-7}{\sigma_tL^2}}
\end{equation}

Simple Furnace test helps us to validate such approximative approach to derive the heuristic
