\section{PTDL volume integrator}

Detailed description of the PTDL for volumetric path tracer.
Direct light sampling from inside the medium. Special case for each light
source. Energy conservation tests.


\section{Combining brute force path tracing volume integrator with PTDL. MIS}
It was not implemented yet. Low priority section.
