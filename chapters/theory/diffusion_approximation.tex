\section{The Diffusion Approximation}
Applies to the highly scattering media: relation to the Central Limit Theorem.
The underlying approach is similar to using a normal distribution for the sum of random variables.
In the latter setting, the central limit theorem permits one to replace the analytically intractable
sum of random variables by an appropriately chosen normal random variable.

Probably first description is \cite{Stam1995}

Geometric assumption on the surface as a flat, semi-infinite slab at (any point). This is reasonable
only if scattering distance is small with respect to surface curvature and thickness.
\textbf{Multiple scattering} diffusion component is approximately determined. The \textbf{single
scattering} is separately integrated.
